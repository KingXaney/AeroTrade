# Deprecation and Migration

## Overview

Code is a liability, not an asset. Every line of code has ongoing maintenance cost â€” bugs to fix, dependencies to update, security patches to apply, and new engineers to onboard. Deprecation is the discipline of removing code that no longer earns its keep, and migration is the process of moving users safely from the old to the new.

Most engineering organizations are good at building things. Few are good at removing them. This skill addresses that gap.

## When to Use

- Replacing an old system, API, or library with a new one
- Sunsetting a feature that's no longer needed
- Consolidating duplicate implementations
- Removing dead code that nobody owns but everybody depends on
- Planning the lifecycle of a new system (deprecation planning starts at design time)
- Deciding whether to maintain a legacy system or invest in migration

## Core Principles

### Code Is a Liability

Every line of code has ongoing cost: it needs tests, documentation, security patches, dependency updates, and mental overhead for anyone working nearby. The value of code is the functionality it provides, not the code itself. When the same functionality can be provided with less code, less complexity, or better abstractions â€” the old code should go.

### Hyrum's Law Makes Removal Hard

With enough users, every observable behavior becomes depended on â€” including bugs, timing quirks, and undocumented side effects. This is why deprecation requires active migration, not just announcement. Users can't "just switch" when they depend on behaviors the replacement doesn't replicate.

### Deprecation Planning Starts at Design Time

When building something new, ask: "How would we remove this in 3 years?" Systems designed with clean interfaces, feature flags, and minimal surface area are easier to deprecate than systems that leak implementation details everywhere.

## The Deprecation Decision

Before deprecating anything, answer these questions:

```
1. Does this system still provide unique value?
   â†’ If yes, maintain it. If no, proceed.

2. How many users/consumers depend on it?
   â†’ Quantify the migration scope.

3. Does a replacement exist?
   â†’ If no, build the replacement first. Don't deprecate without an alternative.

4. What's the migration cost for each consumer?
   â†’ If trivially automated, do it. If manual and high-effort, weigh against maintenance cost.

5. What's the ongoing maintenance cost of NOT deprecating?
   â†’ Security risk, engineer time, opportunity cost of complexity.
```

## Compulsory vs Advisory Deprecation

| Type | When to Use | Mechanism |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Advisory** | Migration is optional, old system is stable | Warnings, documentation, nudges. Users migrate on their own timeline. |
| **Compulsory** | Old system has security issues, blocks progress, or maintenance cost is unsustainable | Hard deadline. Old system will be removed by date X. Provide migration tooling. |

**Default to advisory.** Use compulsory only when the maintenance cost or risk justifies forcing migration. Compulsory deprecation requires providing migration tooling, documentation, and support â€” you can't just announce a deadline.

## The Migration Process

### Step 1: Build the Replacement

Don't deprecate without a working alternative. The replacement must:

- Cover all critical use cases of the old system
- Have documentation and migration gui
