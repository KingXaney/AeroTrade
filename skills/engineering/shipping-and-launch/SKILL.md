# Shipping and Launch

## Overview

Ship with confidence. The goal is not just to deploy â€” it's to deploy safely, with monitoring in place, a rollback plan ready, and a clear understanding of what success looks like. Every launch should be reversible, observable, and incremental.

## When to Use

- Deploying a feature to production for the first time
- Releasing a significant change to users
- Migrating data or infrastructure
- Opening a beta or early access program
- Any deployment that carries risk (all of them)

## The Pre-Launch Checklist

### Code Quality

- [ ] All tests pass (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Build succeeds with no warnings
- [ ] Lint and type checking pass
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] No TODO comments that should be resolved before launch
- [ ] No `console.log` debugging statements in production code
- [ ] Error handling covers expected failure modes

### Security

- [ ] No secrets in code or version control
- [ ] `npm audit` shows no critical or high vulnerabilities
- [ ] Input validation on all user-facing endpoints
- [ ] Authentication and authorization checks in place
- [ ] Security headers configured (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- [ ] CORS configured to specific origins (not wildcard)

### Performance

- [ ] Core Web Vitals within "Good" thresholds
- [ ] No N+1 queries in critical paths
- [ ] Images optimized (compression, responsive sizes, lazy loading)
- [ ] Bundle size within budget
- [ ] Database queries have appropriate indexes
- [ ] Caching configured for static assets and repeated queries

### Accessibility

- [ ] Keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
- [ ] Screen reader can convey page content and structure
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA (4.5:1 for text)
- [ ] Focus management correct for modals and dynamic content
- [ ] Error messages are descriptive and associated with form fields
- [ ] No accessibility warnings in axe-core or Lighthouse

### Infrastructure

- [ ] Environment variables set in production
- [ ] Database migrations applied (or ready to apply)
- [ ] DNS and SSL configured
- [ ] CDN configured for static assets
- [ ] Logging and error reporting configured
- [ ] Health check endpoint exists and responds

### Documentation

- [ ] README updated with any new setup requirements
- [ ] API documentation current
- [ ] ADRs written for any architectural decisions
- [ ] Changelog updated
- [ ] User-facing documentation updated (if applicable)

## Feature Flag Strategy

Ship behind feature flags to decouple deployment from release:

```typescript
// Feature flag check
const flags = await getFeatureFlags(userId);

if (flags.taskSharing) {
  // New feature: task sharing
  return <TaskSharingPanel task={task} />;
}

// Default: existing behavior
return null;
```

**Feature flag lifecycle:**

```
1. DEPLOY with flag OFF     â†’ Code is in production but inactive
2. ENABLE for team/beta     â†’ Internal testing in production environment
3. GRADUAL ROLLOUT          â†’ 5% â†’ 25% â†’ 50% â†’ 100% of users
4. MONITOR at each stage    â†’ Watch error rates, performance, user feedback
5. CLEAN UP                 â†’ Remove flag and dead code path after full rollout
```

**Rules:**
- Every feature flag has an owner and an expiration date
- Clean up flags within 2 weeks of full rollout
- Don't nest feature flags (creates exponential combinations)
- Test both flag states (on and off) in CI

## Staged Rollout

### The Rollout Sequence

```
1. DEPLOY to staging
   â””â”€â”€ Full test suite in staging environment
   â””â”€â”€ Manual smoke test of critical flows

2. DEPLOY to production (feature flag OFF)
   â””â”€â”€ Verify deployment succeeded (health check)
   â””â”€â”€ Check error monitoring (no new errors)

3. ENABLE for team (flag ON for internal users)
   â””â”€â”€ Team uses the feature in production
   â””â”€â”€ 24-hour monitoring window

4. CANARY rollout (flag ON for 5% of users)
   â””â”€â”€ Monitor error rates, latency, user
